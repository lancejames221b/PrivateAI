# Introduction to AI Privacy Proxy

## The Problem: Privacy Risks in AI Interactions

When interacting with AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, or other large language models, sensitive information can easily be included in prompts and responses. This creates privacy and security risks, such as:

- **Sensitive Data Leakage**: Organization names, internal project details, or credentials may be inadvertently shared
- **PII Exposure**: Names, email addresses, and other personally identifiable information can be sent to AI providers
- **Metadata Association**: AI providers could potentially build profiles of your organization based on repeated queries
- **Regulatory Compliance Issues**: Data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA may be violated

## The Solution: AI Privacy Proxy

The AI Privacy Proxy acts as a secure middleware layer between your applications and AI services. It:

1. **Intercepts Requests**: Captures outgoing API calls to AI services
2. **Detects Sensitive Information**: Uses multiple methods to identify PII, credentials, organization names, etc.
3. **Transforms Content**: Replaces sensitive data with consistent, anonymous placeholders
4. **Forwards to AI Service**: Sends the anonymized request to the intended AI service
5. **Restores Context**: Applies reverse transformations to responses, restoring the original context
6. **Returns Clean Results**: Delivers a useful response with sensitive information intact

## Key Components

### Core Components

- **Proxy Server**: Intercepts HTTP/HTTPS traffic to AI APIs
- **PII Transform Engine**: Detects and replaces sensitive information
- **Codename Generator**: Creates consistent replacements for organizations and domains
- **Bidirectional Mapping System**: Stores relationships between original values and replacements
- **Admin Interface**: Web-based dashboard for configuration and monitoring

### Detection Methods

The system uses multiple complementary approaches to detect sensitive information:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Regular expressions to identify common formats (email addresses, API keys, etc.)
2. **Named Entity Recognition**: ML models to identify organizations, people, locations, etc.
3. **Microsoft Presidio Integration**: Enterprise-grade PII detection framework
4. **Custom Rules**: User-defined patterns for organization-specific information

## Benefits

- **Privacy Preservation**: Keep sensitive information within your organization
- **Consistent Anonymization**: Same entities always get the same replacements
- **Contextual Integrity**: AI responses remain coherent and useful
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Help meet data protection requirements
- **Visibility and Control**: Monitor what information is detected and how it's handled

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise AI Integration**: Securely connect internal systems to public AI APIs
- **Healthcare**: Protect patient information while using AI for analysis
- **Software Development**: Share code snippets without exposing internal details
- **Legal**: Process documents while maintaining confidentiality
- **Security Operations**: Get AI assistance with logs and alerts without leaking internal data

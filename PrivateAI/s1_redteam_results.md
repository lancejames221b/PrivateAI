# SentinelOne Red Team Simulation Results

This document presents the findings from a simulated red team engagement targeting SentinelOne, comparing protected and unprotected interactions with Claude AI via OpenRouter.

## Overview

We conducted 9 separate query stages with increasing sensitivity, both with and without the Private AI security proxy enabled. The goal was to determine the effectiveness of the proxy in preventing disclosure of sensitive SentinelOne configuration information.

## Test Scenario

The test simulated an attacker attempting to extract information about:
- SentinelOne console URLs
- API tokens and their formats
- Agent IDs and their structure
- Site and Group IDs
- Vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques

## Key Findings

### 1. Entity Recognition and Redaction

| Entity Type | Protected Mode | Unprotected Mode |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Company Name (SentinelOne) | Replaced with `<ORGANIZATION>` | Fully disclosed |
| Console URLs | Replaced with `<URL>` | Fully disclosed |
| API Tokens | Partially protected | Fully disclosed |
| Agent IDs | Partially protected | Fully disclosed |  
| Site/Group IDs | Replaced with `<US_SSN>` | Fully disclosed |

### 2. Information Disclosure Comparison

#### Protected Mode:
- Claude was unable to identify SentinelOne as the product being discussed
- All SentinelOne domains were blocked
- Site and Group IDs were redacted
- Claude refused to provide specific information about the redacted entities
- Claude could not construct valid API calls or analyze configuration

#### Unprotected Mode:
- Claude provided detailed information about SentinelOne products and services
- Claude described the standard format for SentinelOne agent IDs in detail
- Claude analyzed the configuration and noted issues (like duplicate Group IDs)
- Claude provided a template for API calls to the SentinelOne API
- Claude still refused to provide vulnerability information (ethical stance)

### 3. Security Impact Analysis

The information disclosed in unprotected mode could potentially be used by attackers to:

1. **Understand Internal Structure**: Learn about SentinelOne's console URL patterns, agent ID formats, and API structures which could aid in crafting targeted attacks.

2. **Target Attack Vectors**: Gather information about how SentinelOne components interact, potentially revealing attack surfaces.

3. **Craft Convincing Phishing**: Use the disclosed information to create more convincing phishing attempts targeting SentinelOne administrators.

4. **Attempt API Access**: Although Claude did not provide a valid API call due to token format concerns, it did reveal the expected API endpoint structure and authentication mechanism.

## Conclusion

The Private AI security proxy was highly effective in preventing the disclosure of sensitive SentinelOne information. In protected mode, Claude was unable to determine the specific product being discussed, analyze configuration details, or provide guidance on API interactions.

The most notable findings:

1. **Security through Abstraction**: By replacing specific entity types with abstract placeholders, the system prevented Claude from making connections and revealing proprietary information.

2. **Domain Protection**: All SentinelOne domains were successfully redacted, preventing information about the management console structure.

3. **ID Protection**: Site and Group IDs were properly redacted, protecting internal infrastructure information.

4. **Graceful Declining**: Claude responded appropriately to the redacted prompts, refusing to speculate or provide information based on the placeholder values.

## Recommendations

1. **Continue Using the Security Proxy**: The proxy demonstrated effective protection of sensitive information during API interactions.

2. **Expand Pattern Coverage**: Consider adding more specific patterns for SentinelOne identifiers to ensure complete coverage.

3. **Enhance Agent ID Protection**: The proxy only partially protected some agent IDs. Adding more specific patterns would improve this coverage.

4. **Review Domain Blocklist**: Ensure all SentinelOne subdomains are included in the domain blocklist.

5. **Regular Testing**: Conduct periodic red team simulations to verify the continued effectiveness of the protection measures as AI models evolve.

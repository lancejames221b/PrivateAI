# IDE AI Traffic Interception - Research Summary

## Overview

Based on the research findings, we've implemented a comprehensive solution for automatically detecting, intercepting, and applying PII protection to traffic destined for AI services, with a focus on IDE-based AI assistants. This document summarizes the key findings and implementation details.

## Key Research Findings

### IDE Traffic Interception

1. **Communication Patterns**:
   - Most IDE AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, VS Code AI, JetBrains AI) use HTTPS for communication
   - GitHub Copilot uses a JSON-RPC protocol over HTTPS
   - Some assistants like Cursor may use WebSockets for real-time interactions
   - Each assistant typically uses custom HTTP headers for authentication and client identification

2. **Proxy Respect**:
   - Most IDE tools respect system-wide proxy settings (HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY environment variables)
   - JetBrains IDEs and VS Code have their own proxy configuration settings that need to be explicitly set
   - Some IDEs require disabling strict SSL validation to work with MITM proxies

3. **System-wide Proxy Configuration**:
   - macOS: Network Settings + environment variables
   - Windows: Windows Settings + registry entries + environment variables
   - Linux: Environment variables + desktop-specific settings (GNOME/KDE)

### Universal AI Endpoint Detection

1. **Effective Heuristics**:
   - Path patterns: `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, `/generate`, etc.
   - Request patterns: Presence of fields like `prompt`, `messages`, `model`, `temperature`
   - IDE-specific indicators: Fields like `prefix`, `suffix`, `document`, `position`, `language`
   - Header patterns: Custom headers with IDE or vendor identification

2. **Dynamic Identification**:
   - Combining domain-based filtering with content-based heuristics provides the most reliable detection
   - JSON structure analysis can identify AI payloads even from unknown domains
   - The balance between false positives and missed detections can be tuned via keywords and patterns

### Adaptive Payload Handling

1. **Common JSON Structures**:
   - Most AI APIs use a key for input content (`prompt`, `messages`, `input`, `query`)
   - Most responses contain content under standardized keys (`text`, `content`, `completion`, `message`)
   - Despite different formats, AI payloads follow predictable patterns that can be transformed

2. **Format Standardization**:
   - Converting all formats to OpenAI's format (with `messages` array) provides a consistent base for PII protection
   - After processing, converting back to the original format maintains compatibility
   - Some assistants require preserving specific fields and formats for proper functioning

### Certificate Trust for IDEs/Tools

1. **Trust Mechanisms**:
   - Most IDEs use the system's CA trust store, but some have their own stores
   - VS Code and Electron-based editors may need explicit configuration
   - JetBrains IDEs have their own certificate management system
   - Windows, macOS, and Linux have different certificate installation mechanisms

## Implementation

Based on these findings, we've implemented:

1. **Modular Format Detection and Adaptation System**:
   - `ai_format_adapter.py`: Main orchestrator
   - `ai_format_detector.py`: Detects various AI API formats
   - `ai_format_request_adapters.py`: Converts requests to standardized format
   - `ai_format_response_adapters.py`: Converts responses back to original format

2. **Enhanced Proxy Interceptor**:
   - Updated `proxy_intercept.py` with heuristic-based detection
   - Added support for IDE-specific formats
   - Implemented smarter request and response transformation

3. **Certificate and Proxy Setup Utilities**:
   - `setup_certificates.py`: Manages certificate generation and installation
   - `setup_proxy.py`: Configures system-wide proxy settings

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - `docs/ide-ai-integration.md`: Detailed setup and usage guide

5. **Test Suite**:
   - `test_ai_format_adapter.py`: Verifies format detection and adaptation functionality

## Supported IDE AI Assistants

The implementation includes support for:

- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor AI
- VS Code AI
- JetBrains AI
- Codeium
- TabNine
- Sourcegraph Cody
- AWS CodeWhisperer
- Replit AI
- Kite

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Deploy as a local proxy service on developer machines
   - Consider integrating with IDE plugins for tighter integration

2. **Monitoring and Updating**:
   - Implement monitoring for unidentified AI traffic
   - Create an update mechanism for new format detection and adaptation

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use caching to improve performance
   - Consider selective processing based on content size

4. **Documentation and Onboarding**:
   - Provide IDE-specific setup guides
   - Create troubleshooting documentation for common issues

## Conclusion

The implemented solution successfully addresses the research goals by providing a robust mechanism for detecting and protecting AI traffic, particularly from IDE-based AI assistants. The modular design allows for easy extension to support new AI formats as they emerge.

By leveraging a combination of known endpoints, heuristic detection, and format standardization, the system can provide PII protection without requiring extensive manual configuration, while still offering the flexibility to handle edge cases through manual configuration when needed.

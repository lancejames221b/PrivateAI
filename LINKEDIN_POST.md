# LinkedIn Post: Private AI Update - Now with Plugin Architecture and Multi-Tool Support

🔄 **Exciting update to Private AI - now with plugin architecture and support for all AI-powered development tools!** 🔄

Following yesterday's initial release of Private AI, I'm thrilled to share today's significant improvements:

## 🔌 New Plugin Architecture
I've completely refactored Private AI with a modular plugin system that makes it:
- Easier to extend to new AI services
- More maintainable with clear separation of concerns
- Simpler to configure with JSON-based settings

## 🛠️ Multi-Tool Support
Private AI now protects your code across ALL AI-powered development tools, not just GitHub Copilot:
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Amazon CodeWhisperer
- Tabnine
- Sourcegraph
- Codeium
- Cursor
- Replit
- Kite
- JetBrains

## 🔍 Enhanced PII Detection
I've improved the transformer-based detection models to better identify:
- API keys and credentials
- Personal information
- Internal company data
- Database connection strings
- IP addresses and server paths

## 📊 Detailed Privacy Metrics
The new analysis tools provide comprehensive metrics on:
- What sensitive information was detected
- How it was transformed
- Which AI tools were accessing your code

## 🚀 Simplified Usage
Everything is now accessible through a single command-line interface:
```bash
./private_ai.sh launch   # Launch with privacy protection
./private_ai.sh analyze  # Analyze captured traffic
./private_ai.sh test     # Create test files with known PII
```

Private AI continues to ensure you can leverage AI coding assistants without compromising sensitive information. The new plugin architecture makes it future-proof as new AI tools emerge.

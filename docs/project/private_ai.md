# Private AI Proxy Design and Implementation Plan

Private AI Proxy is a middleware solution that focuses on protecting sensitive information in AI model interactions by processing input and output data streams. This design document outlines the architecture for securing model communications while preserving utility.

## Design Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Input Processor**: A streaming service that sanitizes data before it reaches AI models. Handles prompt engineering, token streams, and embeddings. This component will:
- Filter sensitive information from model inputs
- Transform prompts to remove identifiable data
- Sanitize code samples and technical content
- Maintain prompt effectiveness while removing sensitive details
1. **Detection Engine**: A hybrid pattern-matching system combining:
- Real-time token stream analysis for PII and sensitive data
- Vector similarity checks for semantic data leakage
- Content filtering optimized for model inputs/outputs
- Pattern matching focused on model-relevant data types like prompts, completions, and embeddings
1. **Output Processor**: An intelligent component that:
- Analyzes model responses for sensitive information leakage
- Maintains consistent anonymization across conversation turns
- Prevents model hallucination of sensitive details
- Ensures output quality while enforcing privacy
1. **Administration Dashboard**: A web interface for managing model interactions, reviewing transformations, and monitoring privacy metrics.

## Implementation Strategy

To rapidly develop an effective privacy layer for AI interactions, we recommend:

1. **Streaming Architecture**: Build on existing streaming frameworks to process model I/O in real-time
2. **Token-Level Processing**: Implement privacy checks at the token level for maximum granularity
3. **Async Pipeline**: Use async processing to minimize latency impact on model interactions
4. **Two-Phase Rollout**:
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): Basic input/output sanitization and token filtering
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): Advanced semantic analysis and privacy preservation

## Technology Stack

1. **Processing Pipeline**: Python with transformers for token processing
2. **Privacy Checks**: Custom ML models for privacy-sensitive token detection
3. **Monitoring**: Real-time analytics for privacy metrics
4. **Storage**: Vector store for semantic privacy checking
5. **Infrastructure**: Containerized streaming architecture

## About Private AI

Private AI is a privacy-preserving middleware that acts as a detective for your data, intercepting communications between your applications and AI services to automatically detect and redact sensitive information before it reaches external AI models.

## Key Features

- **Universal Protection**: Works with all major AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Google, Mistral, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Protects PII, API keys, credentials, and company-specific information
- **Dual Operation Modes**: Run as a proxy server or integrate directly as a library
- **Seamless Integration**: Zero-code changes required for existing applications
- **Bi-directional Protection**: Secures data in both requests and responses

## How It Works

Private AI operates by:

1. **Intercepting Requests**: Acts as a MITM proxy between your application and AI services
2. **Analyzing Content**: Detects sensitive information using pattern matching and NLP techniques
3. **Transforming Data**: Replaces sensitive data with innocuous placeholders
4. **Forwarding Requests**: Sends the sanitized requests to the AI service
5. **Restoring Responses**: Translates placeholders back to original values in responses

## Getting Started

For first-time users, we recommend starting with the [Quick Start Guide](./quickstart.md) or the [Docker Setup Instructions](./deployment/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md).

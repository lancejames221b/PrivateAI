# Security Best Practices for Private AI Proxy

This document outlines the security best practices implemented in the Private AI Proxy application and provides guidance for maintaining a secure deployment.

## Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls are implemented throughout the application.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Components only have access to the resources they need.
3. **Secure by Default**: Security features are enabled by default and require explicit action to disable.
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized before processing.
5. **Secure Communications**: HTTPS is enforced in production environments.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Admin Interface Security

- Basic authentication is enabled by default for the admin interface
- Strong password requirements are enforced
- Authentication credentials are stored securely
- Session management includes secure cookies and proper timeout settings

### API Key Management

- API keys are stored with encryption in the database
- Keys are validated before use to prevent weak or test credentials
- Key rotation is supported through the admin interface
- Keys are never logged in plaintext

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

- PII data is transformed using secure methods
- Database encryption is enabled by default
- Mapping tables use encryption for original values
- File permissions are restricted for sensitive files (600 for .env, 700 for data directory)

### Environment Variables

- Environment variables are validated before use
- The .env file has restricted permissions (600)
- Sensitive values are not logged or exposed in error messages
- Default values are secure

## Web Security

### Content Security Policy

- CSP is implemented using Flask-Talisman
- Inline scripts are restricted using nonces
- External sources are limited to trusted CDNs
- frame-ancestors is set to 'none' to prevent clickjacking

### Additional Security Headers

- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache
- Feature-Policy restrictions

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- HTML escaping is used for user-provided content in responses
- Regular expression patterns are used to validate inputs
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

- Rate limiting is implemented for API endpoints
- Limits are based on client IP address
- Configurable thresholds prevent abuse

### Request Validation

- JSON schema validation for API requests
- Size limits on request payloads
- Content-Type validation

## Proxy Security

### Header Validation

- Custom headers are validated before forwarding
- Dangerous headers are blocked
- Header values are sanitized

### Authentication Handling

- Credentials are validated before use
- Bearer tokens and API keys are handled securely
- Basic auth credentials are properly encoded

## Deployment Security

### Production Configuration

- HTTPS is enforced in production
- Debug mode is disabled
- Error messages are sanitized
- Proper logging levels are set

### File Permissions

- Sensitive files (.env, database) have restricted permissions
- Data directory is protected (700)
- Log files have appropriate permissions

## Security Monitoring

### Logging

- Security events are logged with appropriate detail
- Sensitive data is not logged
- Log rotation is configured
- Log levels are configurable

### Auditing

- Authentication attempts are logged
- Configuration changes are tracked
- API usage is monitored

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates

- Dependencies should be regularly updated
- Security patches should be applied promptly
- Vulnerability scanning should be performed regularly

### Security Testing

- Regular security testing is recommended
- Input validation testing
- Authentication bypass testing
- Authorization testing

## Incident Response

### Preparation

- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Have a plan for responding to security incidents
- Know how to restore from backups

### Recovery

- Ability to revoke compromised credentials
- Process for rotating encryption keys
- Backup and restore procedures

## Conclusion

Following these security best practices will help maintain the security of your Private AI Proxy deployment. Regular security reviews and updates are essential to address new threats and vulnerabilities as they emerge.
